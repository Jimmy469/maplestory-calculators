# Instructions/Notes

Main reason I made this is because I needed a viable bpot calculator but most calculators come from reboot so I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist. I also needed a viable flame calculator for weapons which took into account %all stat and base stat.

There was also 2 different metrics that I wanted to use which I found useful for something which I personally wanted to do which is differentiating between equaling a certain flame threshold and beating it along with expected gain after beating it. The intent is that you put in your current gear stats to find out what kind of gains you'd get out of trying to beat it instead of a preset goal which you're trying to hit. Using this I could make cost comparisons between different kinds of upgrades.

## Usage

Putting in all your stat ratios is probably self-explanatory but in the likely case that you don't want to fill in every section, here are some important sections to know about

* *Base weapon attack:* The amount of attack you get in a flame is reliant on your base weapon attack so when calculating weapons this must be filled out

* *Character level:* Looks pointless but is needed to calculate the +1 per 10 level lines.

* *2ndary/3rdary stat:* Unfortunately a lot of work for xenons and will have to fill out all these sections with 1's. Wouldn't recommend but if you want to be more accurate you can use your stat ratios because xenon stats are not all weighted equally. To fill the ratios properly you would choose either dex str or luk to be your main stat and base all your other stat equivalances off that main stat. Note that this will make calculating your own flame/cube scores very annoying.

* *Crit Dmg:* A lot of people don't realize that this is a common line on bpots so should fill this out when doing bpots to be accurate.

## Cube facts

All this can be deduced from the calculator but there's some really helpful things to know after looking through the data.

* For both main and bonus potential, %Att lines are hardest to roll on Secondary, 2nd hardest to roll on Weapon, and easiest to roll on Emblem. Weapon is harder than Emblem just out of virtue of having boss lines but Secondary actually has more garbage lines than the other 2.

* The difficulty of rolling %stat lines on mpot goes in this order from easiest to hardest. Heart > Shoulder/Belt/Cape > Pants > Shoes > Top > Hat. Accessories range from just above Shoulder/Belt/Cape if you go for lower rolls to just below shoes if you go for higher rolls. Glove is redundant because people don't aim for %Stat and Hat is redundant if you need CDR lines. Badge isn't in kms so I don't know any rates.

* Heart is by far the easiest to cube mpot on with rolling 30%+ stat being more than 1.5x harder on any other gear.

* Top and Hat are by far the hardest to cube mpot on with rolling 30%+ stat being more than 1.5x harder compared to any other gear.

* Armor bpots are easier to roll than Accessory bpots by a bit and Hat/Glove/Heart are hard to judge because of %Crit Dmg and CDR lines.

## Data

Cube data was released for KMS but wasn't entirely sure the prime rates would be the same as GMS. Looked at a bunch of videos and black/red cubes seem to be the same but bpot cubes seem to sit at around 5% instead of 0.4975% which is what I use here.

Number of lines for non-flame advantaged items I just used Suckhard's probabilities which is 1 line: 45%, 2 lines: 35%, 3 lines 15%, 4 lines 5%.

Familiar calculator was also in the makes but the available data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcVLi2Qb5ljiua9lt25hc0Yatf0kJWFDvfctqmbbOKI/edit#gid=1355272261) seemed to have a lot of discrepencies with perceived lines and rates and frankly I don't trust it, so I'll just leave it hanging until some official data comes out or something.
